# Bit-Ryder 128

This is a modified version of the C128 CR home computer.

Changes compared to the C128 CR

- Power supply for the SID chip, 6581 and 8580 can be used.
- The diode networks, which are no longer available, have been replaced by individual diodes.
- I have added a header for the signals of the U36 Megabit adapter.
- And I integrated a simple RF circuit. But the alternative solutions offered by others seem better to me.
- PCB adapted to the size of a standard C128. A CR case is no longer necessary.
- A few cosmetic adjustments.

So it is no longer a 1:1 replica of the C128CR.

So far, all tests have been successful. Including CMD Ramlink, SuperCPU and others.

# Important!

This project is based on the brilliant Open128CR by jgrip. https://codeberg.org/jgrip/Open128CR

# Files

The Gerber and Kicad files will be published. A few tests still need to be carried out first.
